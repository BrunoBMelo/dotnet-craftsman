# Author's tale

When I started in the world of software development, everything was wonderful and easy.
But my Petter Pan world ended when the software I created started taking my sleep away.
Bugs, critical errors, calls from my boss at dawn almost made me give up ...
But as I am Brazilian and do not give up. I decided to seek knowledge and share it. “Listen to the advice and be ready to learn; then one day you will be wise. ”(Proverbs 19.20)

The knowledge made me grow and decrease my boss's calls in the early hours. (Not 100% because the problems are now management, they know the "crunch time")
