# Value object

The '<b>Value Object</b>' is an object that represents a value! basically that. :)
Value Object is mentioned by Eric Evans in his famous <b>DDD</b> book because value objects help in building strong domains avoiding future problems in their modeling and the famous "code smell bad"

# Characteristics

- They are immutable.
- They have no identity.
- Are small.
- Avoids the use of primitive obsession.
- Help with documentation.

# See in practice

Below, I show some of the most common fictional examples today.


``` cs 

string document = "132.545.983-32"; // This value represents a Brazilian document that we call cpf.

var documentIsValid = CPFHelper.Validate(cpf);

if (documentIsValid)
{
    var cpfFormated = CPFHelper.Format(cpf);
    Console.WriteLine(cpfFormated);

    //output: 13254598332
}

```

or

``` cs

public class Customer
{
  public string Id { get; set; }
  
  private readonly string _cpf;
  public string Cpf 
  { 
    get { return _cpf; } 
    set 
    { 
        var documentCpf = CPFHelper.Validate(value);

        if(documentCpf)
        {
            _cpf = CPFHelper.Format(value); 
        }
        else
        {
            throw new CpfException("Any stupid message.");
        }
        
    } 
  }
}

```


## Okay, but what's wrong with the code snippet above? 

If you are using this in your modeling software, you will need to study a little more about good practice and OOP.

> Author: It seems harmless but it is not, there are those who disagree but this excerpt is a "code smell bad" and that's it !!!

Observe the assignment of the value ``"132.545.983-32"`` to the variable ``document`` (As much as there are better ways of implementation in the example above, the result will be the same; big shit).

Realize that ```document``` is a type of ```string``` and to change this value you need some manipulator to perform any treatment. This is where ```Helper``` or ```Util``` Patern is born (or rather, the anti-pattern). Understand that it will be necessary to have another object (Helper) to change the status of the ```document``` but the correct is thing to be an <b>Type</b> and  is to be your own owner and make your decisions.

<b>NOTE:</b> If you are using this type of ```CPFHelper``` (anti-pattern) pattern it means that your modeling went to the hole because something was born wrong and is growing wrong.


We will try to predict the future and imagine the possible problems of this use.

- I predict that you will have duplication of logic to handle this value. At some point you will find someone manipulating
the value which in turn will not be the Helper or Ultil class.

- When the above prophecy happens, armageddon will be near because you will lose control of whoever manipulates this value.

- The value will be assigned by variables with bizarre names, example: ``` _ ```, ``` cpf ```, ``` value ```, ``` customerPerson ```, etc ... Now imagine your system growing and being used and manipulated by 100 methods in 200 classes.

Writing ... will soon be finished ....
